# Quarter-1-Project-Route-Roulette
For this project I created a web application that generates a random rock climb after certain parameters are provided to the query.  The user need to enter a range for the difficulty they are interested in, and how far they are willing to travel, and then a random climb will be generated.  I used mountainproject.com's API to get an object of up to 500 routes that could be selected with each query, and the user's location is generated by the Google Map's geocode feature.

The user has the option to save one route at a time as a "current project", and this is stored using local storage.  The information that the user recieves includes the route name, the difficulty, the type of climb, the quality, the location, and then a link to the actual page on mountainproject.com where more specific information about the route can be found.

The inspiration for this project came from personal experiences where i have had a hard time making a decision on what to climb when I have the day available.  

I used Javascript/ Jquery, HTML, and CSS.
